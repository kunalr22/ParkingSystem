Bugs

- Booking time for from and to in the GUI is "linked"
    i.e. when you change the "from" time, the to time is also changed to the same time, and vice versa.

- Also, booking section in GUI is referring to the booking list when it should refer to the parking spot/lot list
  I think

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To Do:

- We should change the booking implementation to be simpler
    - We should only prompt for the start time, from which a 1 hour booking will be made
    - To implement this, the "to" time should be calculated as "from" time + 1 hour
    - The user can extend this booking by some number of hours (integer) as long as the booking has not ENDED yet
    - We extend the "to" time by the number of hours the user wants to extend the booking by
    - We should probably also store the total hours as an int to easily calculate the total cost

- We need to satisfy the requirement of a deposit
    - The user must pay a deposit to book a parking spot (with its own payment I suppose)

- We need to satisfy the requirement of a no-show fee
    - if the user cancels before the booking time, deposit is refunded
    - if the user cancels after the booking time, the deposit is forfeited

- We need to satisfy the requirement of a sensor detecting a car's presence
    - To do this, we should give the user an extra functionality to "check-in" to the parking spot
    - This will be used to trigger the sensor

- The modify/cancel booking functionality should only be available if the booking has not started yet
    - If the booking has started, the user should not be able to modify or cancel the booking
    - But as mentioned above, the user can extend the booking by some number hours (integer)

Optional:

- Instead of listing all available parking spaces in one "box", we can have two "boxes" for the parking lots/spaces:
    - Left "box" to select from available parking lots
    - Right "box" to select from available parking spaces in the selected parking lot
        - This "box" will be populated with the parking spaces in the selected parking lot
